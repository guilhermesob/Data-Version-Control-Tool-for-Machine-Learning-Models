# Data-Version-Control-Tool-for-Machine-Learning-Models
This project aims to create a data version control tool for Machine Learning models in Julia, focusing on measuring function performance and optimizing computational resource usage. The tool includes runtime measurement, memory usage tracking, and performance logging, providing insights to enhance code efficiency in Machine Learning projects.

# Objectives
Measure Execution Time: Evaluate function performance using time or timeit tools to identify time bottlenecks.
Track Memory Usage: Monitor memory consumption using tracemalloc or memory_profiler to detect potential memory leaks and optimize resource usage.
Custom Logging: Set up a custom logging system to capture and store performance data in a structured format, making it easier to analyze and improve the code continuously.

# Installation
To use this project, you need to have Julia installed on your system. If you don't have Julia installed, you can download it from the official website.

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
https://github.com/guilhermesob/Data-Version-Control-Tool-for-Machine-Learning-Models/
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd data-version-control-ml
```

# Dependencies
This project uses some important libraries that need to be installed:

MemoryProfiler.jl - For monitoring memory usage.
TimerOutputs.jl - For measuring function execution time.
Logging.jl - For custom performance logging.

### Install these dependencies by running the following code in the Julia REPL:
```
using Pkg
Pkg.add("MemoryProfiler")
Pkg.add("TimerOutputs")
Pkg.add("Logging")
```

# Usage Examples
1. Measuring Execution Time
To measure execution time of a function, use TimerOutputs:
```
using TimerOutputs

function my_function()
    # Simulating processing
    sleep(1)
end

@timeit my_function()
```
This code will measure the execution time of the my_function and log the results.

2. Monitoring Memory Usage
You can monitor the memory usage of a function using MemoryProfiler:
```
using MemoryProfiler

function my_memory_function()
    # Simulating memory allocation
    data = rand(10^6)
end

@profile my_memory_function()
```
This will display memory allocations made by the function, helping identify areas with high memory consumption.

3. Custom Logging Setup
The logging tool is set up using the Logging package to capture events during execution:
```
using Logging

function my_function_with_logging()
    @info "Function start"
    # Simulating processing
    sleep(1)
    @info "Function end"
end

my_function_with_logging()
```
This code logs information about the start and end of the function execution, which is useful for tracking performance and identifying bottlenecks.

# Performance Analysis
Measuring and Logging Results
To optimize performance, it's crucial to measure the execution time and memory usage of different parts of the code. This can be done continuously during the development and implementation of Machine Learning models.

# Optimization Techniques
Algorithm Tuning: Replace inefficient algorithms with faster solutions.
Efficient Data Structures: Choose data structures that minimize memory usage.
Parallelization: Use parallelism to better utilize system resources.
